# CPU-Scheduler-FCFS

Algorithm to mirror FCFS and MLFQ CPU scheduling algorithm given predetermined set of process data. 
This was done in an effort to research and gain insight into various CPU scheduling algorithms. 

The more difficult algorithm of the two, MLFQ, is thoroughly commented to provide further understadning and 
insight into my though process and motivations for particular design decisions.
